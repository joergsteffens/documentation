== Opsi-QuickInstall

Opsi-QuickInstall is a program to quickly and easily install an {opsi-server} on the following Linux distributions:

* Debian 9, Debian 10,
* openSUSE Leap 15.1, openSUSE Leap 15.2,
* Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04

[[opsi-quickinstall-download]]
=== Download and first Start

You can download Opsi-QuickInstall as zip-file under the following link:
https://download.uib.de/opsi4.2/experimental/quickinstall/opsi-quick-install.zip .

Unzip the file and open the folder opsi-quickinstall. Now you must decide whether you want to execute the installation with or without graphical user interface. 

Both versions are described below.

You can find more information on the properties QuickInstall asks for in the
opsi-manual under chapter '9.5.10.1 The product l-opsi-server' : https://download.uib.de/opsi4.2/testing/documentation/opsi-manual-v4.2-en.pdf . There you also find the default values of the properties. Different from the manual is only the default-value of the property **allow_reboot**; this one is QuickInstall __false__.

[[opsi-quickinstall-gui]]
=== Opsi-Quickinstall GUI-Version

Open the folder 'gui' and execute the file 'opsi_quick_install_project' (for example per double click).

A window appears in which you can first select the language for Opsi-QuickInstall and the type of installation:

.Language and type of installation

In the custom installation you can make more detailed settings.

Click on 'next>' and answer the questions. For some questions you will find information signs on the right hand side. These can give you more information about the question on mouse click.

.Information

The questions on name and password of the opsi admin user give example values (also shown on the image <<Information>>). For security reasons you should change these values. Do NOT use the examples!

After the queries, QuickInstall will show you an overview where you can check all your answers. If everything is correct, click 'finish', type in your password and click 'finish' again. Then the installation of the {opsi-server} will start.

If the result is 'success', your {opsi-server} ist now ready for use. + 
If the result is 'failed', you can search in the log files for the error or, if you have a support contract, you can directly contact uib.


[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui]]
=== Opsi-Quickinstall No-GUI-Version

[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui_start]]
==== Start

Open the folder 'nogui' and execute the file 'opsi_quick_install_project' with one of the following parameters on the console as root:

* `-d`, to use the default values for the installation of the {opsi-server} and immediately start the installation,
* `-f <file>`, to use the values from a file for the installation of the {opsi-server} and immediately start the installation,
* `-n`, (recommended) to start a setup program on the console, in which you can set the values for the installation seperately.

So for example execute
----
sudo ./opsi_quick_install_project -n
----

The operation of the setup program is shortly described in the following.

[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui_setup]]
==== Setup Program

If you chose the parameter `-n`, answer the questions that are asked. On each question you also have the possibility to type in one of the following commands:

* `-b`, to jump back to the previous question,
* `-h`, (only for questions that are marked with a `*` at the end) to get further information on this question,
* type nothing in and press Enter to use the default value for this question.

Afterwards QuickInstall will show you an overview where you can check all your answers. If everything is correct, click Enter to start the installation of the {opsi-server}.
