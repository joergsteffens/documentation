[[opsi-manual-modules]]
=== Activation of non free modules

opsi is open source, nevertheless there are some components which are at the moment not free but in their cofunding periods. That is
they are developped and maintained in a project which has to come up for its costs.

At this time (December 2016), this refers to the the following components :

* the MySQL backend for configuration data (see <<opsi-manual-backends-mysql-configdata-overview>>)
* UEFI Support (see <<opsi-manual-uefi>>)
* the opsi license management module (see <<opsi-manual-licensemanagement>>)
* support for clients accessed in a WAN/VPN connection  (see <<opsi-manual-wansupport>>)
* opsi WIM Capture (see <<opsi-manual-wimcap>>)
* opsi Local Image (see <<opsi-manual-localimage>>) and opsi-vhd-reset (see <<opsi-manual-vhd>>)
* opsi Linux Agent (see <<opsi-manual-linux>>)
* opsi Nagios Connector (see <<opsi-Nagios-Connector>>)
* the user roles functionality (see <<opsi-manual-configed-hostproperties-userroles>>)
* the scalability1 extension to increase performance for very large installations

For additional information please have a look at our website: link:https://uib.de/en/opsi-cofunding/cofunding/[opsi cofunding projects]

As long as the components are in their cofunding state  they are only allowed to be used for evaluation purposes or based on paying the cofunding fee.

To verify the use of these components as long as they are not free the opsi files include an activation file `/etc/opsi/modules`.
It is just a plain text file with the data which module is activated for how many clients, protected via a digital signature.
MIssing entries in the file are supplemented with the default values  If the activation file doesn't exist at all only the 'free' parts of opsi will work.

If you need a temporary valid activation file to evaluate extensions please contact info@uib.de.
If you become a co-funder, you will get an activation file for permanent and regular use.

When you got an activation file, put it with 'root' privileges into the directory `/etc/opsi` (and rename it to `modules` if necessary). If this is done, execute:

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-setup --set-rights /etc/opsi
----

and restart the 'opsiconfd'.

You may then check your activation state with one of the following methods:

Using the 'opsi-configed' choose the menu entry 'Help/opsi-Module' which shows a window with the activation state.

.Display of activation state in opsi-configed
image::modules-status.png["Display of activation state in opsi-configed",width=200]

At the command line you may use the command 'opsi-admin' with the method `backend_info`.

NOTE: Never give your activation file or the output of this command to third people without removing its signature entry.

[source, prompt]
----
$ opsi-admin -d method backend_info
