[[opsi-manual-modules]]
=== Activation of non-free modules

Even if opsi is open source, there are some additional components that were created or maintained as part of a co-funding project and are not (yet) free of charge.

At the moment (December 2016) these are:

* MySQL backend for configuration data (see <<opsi-manual-backends-mysql-configdata-overview,mysql backend for configuration data>>)
* UEFI support (see <<opsi-manual-uefi,opsi with UEFI>>)
* opsi license management module (see <<opsi-manual-licensemanagement,opsi License Management>>)
* Support for clients over WAN/VPN (see <<opsi-manual-wansupport,opsi WAN/VPN extension>>)
* opsi WIM Capture (see <<opsi-manual-wimcap,opsi WIM Capture>>)
* opsi local image (see <<opsi-manual-localimage,opsi local image>>) and opsi-vhd-reset (see <<opsi-manual-vhd,opsi vhd reset>>)
* opsi Linux agent (see <<opsi-manual-linux,opsi Linux Support>>)
* opsi Nagios connector (see <<opsi-Nagios-Connector,opsi Nagios Connector>>)
* User roles (see <<opsi-manual-configed-hostproperties-userroles,Management of user rights and roles>>)
* the Scalability1 extension to increase performance in very large installations

You can find more information on this topic at link:https://www.uib.de/en/opsi-cofunding/cofunding/[opsi cofunding projects].

As long as the additional extensions are in the cofunding state, they can only be used freely for evaluation purposes, but for permanent
and normal use the cofunding contributions must be paid.

Which modules are allowed is specified on the opsi server in the activation file `/etc/opsi/modules`.
It is a simple text file with information about which module is activated (for what number of clients).
This file is protected against changes with a digital signature. If no information is given, the default values are used.
If the activation file does not exist, only the default free components from opsi are available.
In the case of temporary activation, the expiration date is included in the file.

In order to receive a temporary activation file for evaluation purposes, please contact info@uib.de.
As part of participation in the corresponding cofunding projects, you will receive an activation file for the permanent and normal use of the activated components.

When you have received a `modules`-file, copy it to `/etc/opsi`.

Then run the following command to set the correct access rights:

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-setup --set-rights /etc/opsi
----

Then restart 'opsiconfd'.

Check the activation using one of the following methods:

In opsi-configed you can display the status of your activation via the menu item 'Help / opsi modules'.

.Display of activation state in opsi-configed
image::modules-status.png["Display of activation state in opsi-configed", pdfwidth=60%]

Using the method `backend_info` you can check with {opsi-admin} which modules are activated.

NOTE: Do not publicly share the file or the output of this command, at least not without deleting the signature.

[source, prompt]
----
$ opsi-admin -d method backend_info
{
	"opsiVersion" : "4.0.1",
	"modules": {
		"customer" : "uib GmbH",
		"vista" : true,
		"vpn" : true,
		"license_management" : true,
		"expires" : "never",
		"valid" : true,
		"multiplex" : true,
		"signature" : "THIS-IS-NO-VALID-SIGNATURE",
		"treeview" : true,
		"mysql_backend" : true
	}
}
