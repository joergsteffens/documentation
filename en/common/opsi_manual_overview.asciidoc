[[opsi-manual-overview]]
== Overview of opsi

Automated software and operating system deployment tools are important and necessary for standardizing, managing and reducing the operating cost of large PC networks. Although necessary, such tools compound licensing costs. Opsi offers a remarkable advantage as an open source tool. This means you limit your expenses to consulting, training, maintenance services, or to uib's cofinanced proprietary low-cost modules.

Although the software and the handbooks themselves are free, the process of introducing a software distribution tool is time intensive. Avoid the setbacks of a lengthy learning curve through our experienced system administrators. Uib offers training courses and consultancy services focused exclusively on opsi.

The opsi system, developed by uib, runs on Linux-servers. These servers install, manage and maintain PC-client operating systems and software packages (PC-Server integration). This system uses open source tools such as GNU-tools and SAMBA, among others. Opsi (Open PC-Server-Integration) is an interesting solution for administering large PC networks, due to its modularity and configurability.

[[opsi-manual-overview-experience]]
=== Experience

Opsi is a continuation of a concept, used non-stop by the state government, with 2000+ Client-PCs in different locations, since the mid 90s. It has improved and further developed since. Opsi is today within reach of a wide range of interested parties.

[[opsi-manual-overview-structure]]
=== Architecture


Opsi requires a data repository. External components communicate with the opsi server through a web service. The 'opsiconfd' process provides the web service and transfers data to the backend manager, who writes it to the configured backend.    

opsi supports different backends: 

* File based
* MySQL based

Refer to Section 5.6, "opsi data storage (backends)" for additional information regarding data repositories.
 <<opsi-manual-backends>>.


The `/etc/opsi/backendManager` and `/etc/opsi/backends` files configure the backend.

image::opsibackend_configuration_layers.png["Scheme: backend layers and access control", width=400]

`/etc/opsi/backends` defines the backends configuration. 

`/etc/opsi/backendManager/dispatch.conf` displays active backends and their purpose.  

`/etc/opsi/backendManager/acl.conf` defines method access control. 

`/etc/opsi/backendManager/extend.d` defines opsi extended methods. 

The `/etc/opsi/backendManager/extend.d/20_legacy.conf` file defines the mapping of the process-based methods (legacy) to the object-based methods. Refer to the "General Configuration files in /etc" section for detailed descriptions of these configuration files.
