[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-overview]]
== Overview of the new features

*Main aspects of this release are:*

* opsi Server
** Switch to Python 3
** New services


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-important]]
== Important considerations - Please pay attention

opsi 4.2 is an independent release and thus has it's own package repositories.
These must be added into the system you want to update before installation.

For an update from opsi 4.0 the packages need to be the latest version available on the stable repositories.
Other packages - such as MySQL server - should also be up-to-date.
Otherwise problems are to be expected during the update.

The replacement of `opsi-product-updater` through `opsi-package-updater` brings along a new configuration file that has to be migrated.
The <<opsi-releasenotes-4.1-changes-opsi-package-updater-configfile,migration of the configuration>> is described lat-er in this document.

In the case that you want to automatize the `opsi-product-updater` - For example with a regular Cronjob - or execute a Script, make sure that you switch to `opsi-package-updater`

It is also recommended that 'opsi-winst', 'opsi-client-agent' or 'opsi-linux-client-agent' be updated to the latest version of opsi 4.0 before updating on the clients.

If a message appears after the migration like 'Your hostcontrol backend configuration uses the old format for broadcast addresses...' please check which configuration adjustments are needed in this case at <<opsi-releasenotes-4.1-changes-wake-on-lan-ports, Configurable ports for Wake-On-LAN>>.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-important-dispatch-and-acl.conf]]
=== New behavior of dispatch.conf and acl.conf

opsi 4.1 introduces also changes in the server configuration. In opsi 4.0.x the two files *dispatch.conf* and *acl.conf* under `/etc/opsi/backendManager` have been a symbolic link to the '*.default' files.

[source,prompt]
----
cd /etc/opsi/backendManager
ls -la
dispatch.conf -> dispatch.conf.default
acl.conf -> acl.conf.default
----

With opsi 4.1 these two files are no longer created as symbolic links. The opsi 4.1 packages try to solve such situation automatically before the upgrade is performed.

If both or one of these files exists, the link is tracked and the target file is copied instead of the symbolic link.

Both '*.default' files have been renamed to '*.example' and are now always copied to the usual directory and should only be used as a reference. Otherwise they have no significance.

Thus, after upgrading to 4.1, the system should continue running without problems with the old *dispatch.conf* and *acl.conf* configuration. Nevertheless, we recommend to check these two files again after the upgrade is done.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation]]
== Installation notice

For your own safety, we strongly suggest to create a backup of your backends with {opsi-backup} before updating:
[source,prompt]
----
opsi-backup create
----

The products contained in this release depend on each other in many cases.
Do not try to install just parts of this update.

We recommend to first update the server, and then update the opsi products.

In a multi-depot environment it is recommended to first update the configserver before updating the depots.

To make sure that permissions are applied correctly
we recommend to run `opsi-setup --set-rights` after the installation.
Please be aware that the execution of latter can take several minutes.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-systempackages]]
=== Advice for updating the operating system packages

Please make sure that at the time of the update you are using the latest packages from opsi 4.0 from the stable branch.

Due to the fact that this update also brings changes to the data structure on the backend
it is required to first migrate the backends after the update.

On UCS the backend is migrated as part of the join script and a manual migration is not required.

The 'opsi-tftpd-hpa' package replaces the 'opsi-atftpd' package.

IMPORTANT: The tftpd line from '/etc/inetd.conf' or '/etc/default/atftpd' needs to be deleted and the inetd service stopped.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-opsipackages]]
=== Notes for updating opsi-packages

opsi-packages are usually compatible with opsi 4.1 and opsi 4.2.

The official opsi 4.1 repositories at _download.uib.de_ contain packages that are compatible with opsi 4.2.
Please note that these packages not necessarily have to contain `4.2` in the version to be compatible.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration]]
=== Migration of an opsi 4.2 server

It is possible to migrate an existing opsi 4.1 installation to opsi 4.2 on supported operating systems.

If you manage your opsi servers through opsi than the migration can be done with the package `l-opsi-server-migrate`.

NOTE: Upgrading from opsi 4.0 to opsi 4.2 is not supported. In this case you have to upgrade to opsi 4.1 first before you can upgrade to opsi 4.2.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration-repositories]]
==== Changing to the new repositories

First the opsi 4.2 package repositories have to be added to the systems package manager.

The following commands will add the repositories and add the new repository key if required.
These commands require 'root' rights.


Will be filled in later - TBD


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration-migrate]]
==== Upgrading OS packages

After adding the new package repositories the system can be migrated.

IMPORTANT: For RPM-based distributions, existing configuration files are replaced by new ones during the migration. Please refer to the notes under the corresponding distributions.

Debian and Ubuntu are updated to opsi 4.2 with the following steps:
[source,prompt]
----
apt update
apt dist-upgrade
----

RedHat and CentOS systems need these steps to upgrade to opsi 4.2:
[source,prompt]
----
yum makecache
yum upgrade
----

To migrate SLES and OpenSUSE please perform the following:
[source,prompt]
----
zypper refresh
zypper dup --from home_uibmz_opsi_4.2_stable
----

On UCS you can update with the following command:
[source,prompt]
----
univention-upgrade
----


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration-opsi-packages]]
==== Updating opsi packages

The last step is to update to the latest opsi packages.

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration-opsi-packages-standard]]
===== Use of the standard configuration

If you did not alter the configuration of your repositories you can simply run the following command:

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-package-updater -v update
----

After these steps, your opsi 4.1 server is migrated to 4.2 and ready to use.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration-cleanup]]
==== Optional cleanup

After a migration it can be that some unrequired files still exist on the server.
The reason for this is that they either have been altered manually or that restoring a backup has brought these files back to the system.

The following files resp. folders can be removed:

* TBD

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-eol]]
== Discontinuation

This chapters lists discontinuations.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-eol_server]]
=== Discontinued: Distributions for opsi-server

These distributions will not be supported anymore for different reasons.

* CentOS 7.x
* Debian 8.x
* Debian 9.x
* RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.x
* Suse Linux Enterprise Server 12

Also see separate chapter: <<opsi-4.2-releasenotes-supportmatrix>>.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-supportmatrix]]
== opsi Support Matrix

An overview of the supported platforms for opsi 4.2 servers.

include::supportmatrix-server.asciidoc[]

If you are using an OS version which is not contained in the section above,
we recommend updating the OS before installing opsi v4.2.


[[opsi-releasenotes-4.2-changes-changed-defaults]]
== Changed Defaults

With opsi 4.2 some default settings have been changed to reflect experiences from opsi operations.

This is important if in an already existing environment new opsi servers are to be installed because this may lead to a change in expected behavior.

* For opsiconfd the setting of `update ip` is `yes` by default.
* In the file 'dispatch.conf' the usage of the mysql backend for keeping the inventory is the new default.


[[opsi-releasenotes-4.2-changes-python]]
== Switch to Python 3

This version is now based on Python 3.
The minimum required version is Python 3.6.
Older versions are not supported anymore. This does include any version of Python 2.
