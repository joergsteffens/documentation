You can download Opsi-Quickinstall as zip-file under the following link:

Both versions are described below.


[[opsi-quickinstall-gui]]

Open the folder 'gui' and execute the file 'opsi_quick_install_project' (for example per double click).

A window appears in which you can first select the language for Opsi-QuickInstall and the type of installation:

In the custom installation you can make more detailed settings; you can find more information on that in the
[lime-background]#[Handbuch]#: [lime-background]#[url]#

Click on 'next>' and answer the questions. For some questions you will find information signs on the right hand side. These can give you more information about the question on mouse click.

Open the folder 'nogui' and execute the file 'opsi_quick_install_project' with parameter -n on the console as root:
----

Answer the questions. On each question you also have the possibility to type in one of the following commands:

* `-b`, to jump back to the previous question,
* `-h`, to get further information on this question,
* type nothing in and press Enter to use the default value for this question. See [lime-background]#[Handbuch]#?

Afterwards QuickInstall will show you an overview where you can check all your answers. If everything is correct, click Enter to start the installation of the opsi-server.
