== Opsi-Quickinstall

[[opsi-quickinstall-download]]
=== Download and first Start

You can download Opsi-Quickinstall as zip-file under the following link:
[lime-background]#[url]#

Now you must decide whether you want to execute the installation with or without graphical user interface. 

Both versions are described below.


[[opsi-quickinstall-gui]]
=== Opsi-Quickinstall GUI-Version

Open the folder 'gui' and execute the file 'opsi_quick_install_project' (for example per double click).

A window appears in which you can first select the language for Opsi-QuickInstall and the type of installation:

In the custom installation you can make more detailed settings; you can find more information on that in the
[lime-background]#[Handbuch]#: [lime-background]#[url]#

Click on 'next>' and answer the questions. For some questions you will find information signs on the right hand side. These can give you more information about the question on mouse click.

Afterwards QuickInstall will show you an overview where you can check all your answers. If everything is correct, click 'finish', type in your password and click 'finish' again. Then the installation of the opsi-server will start.

[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui]]
=== Opsi-Quickinstall No-GUI-Version

[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui_start]]
==== Start

Open the folder 'nogui' and execute the file 'opsi_quick_install_project' with one of the following parameters on the console as root:

* `-d`, to use the default values for the installation of the opsi-server and immediately start the installation,
* `-f <file>`, to use the values from a file for the installation of the opsi-server and immediately start the installation,
* `-n`, (recommended) to start a setup program on the console, in which you can set the values for the installation seperately.

So for example execute
----
sudo ./opsi_quick_install_project -n
----

The operation of the setup program is shortly described in the following.

[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui_setup]]
==== Setup Program

If you chose the parameter `-n`, answer the questions that are asked. On each question you also have the possibility to type in one of the following commands:

* `-b`, to jump back to the previous question,
* `-h`, (only for questions that are marked with a `*` at the end) to get further information on this question,
* type nothing in and press Enter to use the default value for this question. See [lime-background]#[Handbuch]#?

Afterwards QuickInstall will show you an overview where you can check all your answers. If everything is correct, click Enter to start the installation of the opsi-server.
